### Jeffeb3 

Jeff, Heffe, Jeffeb3. I love making machines and I spend idle hours here instead of on facebook or playing video games. I have used to have an MPCNC. I have a Low Rider, MP3DP. and ZenXY. I enjoy a good troubleshooting puzzle. I will not help in private. I have learned too much from public forums to answer questions in private.

I also wrote and maintain sandify.org and v1pi.

I am in github sponsors: github.com/sponsors/jeffeb3
* They are matching 1:1 donations for the first year.

I am also on liberapay.org/jeffeb3

Help me stay motivated by showing me what you are using my software for. You can find me on twitter @jeffeb3 or on gmail.
